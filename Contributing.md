### Contributing Guide

#### How to Start
1. Request Access to Project. 
    - Mail: mail@oliver-karger.de.
    - Send me your Username and why you want access. 
2. Look for something to do
    - either create an Issue if you want a feature or try to fix a bug.
    - use existing Issue.
3. Create you Branch
    - Pattern: `@<username>/<fix|feature>-<issue-id>(-refactoring|develop)`
    - Please use your GitHub Username
    - Examples:
        - `@oliverkarger/feature-1-develop`
        - `@oliverkarger/fix-2-develop`
        - `@oliverkarger/fix-2-test`
        - `@oliverkarger/feature-1-refactoring`
    - Terminology
        - *fix* = fix a Bug
        - *feature* = some new Feature. 
        - *refactoring* = redo a existing Feature or improve a existing Function/Process
        - *develop* = develop something new
    - A *Fix* is usually *refactoring*, you're not developing something new, your fixing something already existing
    - A *Feature* is usually *develop*, you're probably developing something new unless you're improving a existing one.  
4. Once you're done, create a merge request
5. After code review, your code will, if all requirements are met, be merged.
